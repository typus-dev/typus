**Current Situation:**
- Main file: `@typus-core/shared/dsl/models/index.ts` contains manual exports
- Each folder (auth/, cms/, dispatcher/, social/) has its own index.ts with manual exports
- Main index.ts is missing `export * from './social/index.js';`

**Proposed autoloader options:**

## Option 1: Dynamic Runtime Autoloader
Create a function that scans folders during runtime and automatically imports all models. Suitable for development mode.

## Option 2: Build-time Generator
Create a script that automatically generates index.ts files during build by scanning the file system. More performant for production.

## Option 3: Watcher with Auto-generation
Create a file watcher that monitors folder structure changes and automatically updates index.ts files.

## Option 4: TypeScript Barrel Pattern with Globs
Use advanced TypeScript features for automatic exports by patterns.
